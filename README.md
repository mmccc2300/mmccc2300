- 👋 Hi, I’m @mmccc2300
- 👀 I’m an enterprise technology architect with a strong data background (Oracle and MS SQL Server).
- 🌱 I’m currently getting my hands dirty learning how to construct end-to-end architecture from user interface to data storage and analytics using modern, cloud-based, open-source, containerized architecture building blocks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to define an enterprise architecture that can be tightly secured without smothering innovation.
- 📫 I can be reached at mmccc2300@gmail.com
